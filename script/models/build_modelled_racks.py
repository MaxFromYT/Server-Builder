"""Assemble the hand modelled devices into rack models.

The four racks added to the gallery from hardware modelled here shipped
without an authored model, so their detail pages fell back to the procedural
renderer: correct boxes in correct positions, drawn from the rack definition,
and nothing like the devices themselves. The detailed geometry existed the
whole time and nothing put it in a frame.

This is the step that was missing. Every device already knows how to draw
itself into a rack at a given height, because that is the signature the
preview harness has always called: `build(rack, z)`. So a rack model is that
call, once per device, at the height the definition says, inside a frame.

The composition is shared and the geometry is not. Each device still draws
its own jacks, cages, lamps and materials from its own photographs; this file
only decides what goes where, which is exactly the part a rack elevation is
allowed to have an opinion about.

Positions come from the same RackDefinition the page renders, read out of the
published dataset rather than restated here. A generator that keeps its own
copy of the layout is how the older rack models drifted from their
definitions twice, and check-rack-models exists because of it.
