"""Build every hand modelled device to a GLB, and catalogue what came out.

The modules in `devices/` are generators, not models. Running one produces a
GLB; until something runs them, the work exists as code that could make a
switch rather than as a switch anybody can see. This is the step that was
missing: twenty three products were modelled, verified against photographs,
and committed, and not one of them was on the site.

Output mirrors the Ubiquiti catalogue's shape on purpose, because the rack
builder already reads that shape. A device from here and a device from
Ubiquiti differ in exactly two ways that matter downstream, and both are
recorded per entry rather than inferred: ours are Z up, because that is the
frame the generators draw in, and ours carry no baked textures, so they need
no KTX2 transcode.
