"""Shared scaffolding for a full height 42U enterprise rack.

The UniFi hero rack is a shallow studio frame on casters and it carries
the part library everything else builds on. A vendor rack is a different
object: 42 units of four post steel bolted to the floor, rails punched
three holes per unit, and a stack of hardware that has nothing in common
with a studio frame except the 19 inch mounting width.

That difference is the same for every vendor, so it lives here, and a
vendor module only has to describe its own hardware.

Coordinates follow the UniFi builder: x across the face, y into the rack
with the front at `front_y`, z up.
