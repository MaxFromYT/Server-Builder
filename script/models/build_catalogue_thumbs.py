"""Catalogue thumbnails for the vendor models, cut out rather than shot on a ground.

WHY THIS EXISTS AS A FILE. The first pass at these was run by hand and never
committed, which is how thirty eight of them ended up missing with no way to
regenerate the rest. This is the whole job: render, trim, encode, and write
the paths back into the catalogue, from a clean checkout.

WHY TRANSPARENT. The preview studio has a near white ground, which is the
right thing for judging a model against the pages it ships on and the wrong
thing for a product shot, because most of Ubiquiti's hardware is white. On
the first pass thirty eight models rendered as a white object on a white
field and trimmed to an empty rectangle, so the catalogue honestly dropped
their thumb key rather than promising a blank card. Any fixed colour just
moves that problem onto whichever products happen to match it. Cutting the
background out instead means the card behind the image supplies the ground,
which on this site is dark, and every product reads: the white ones by their
shadowed edges, the black ones by their highlights.

TRIMMING is to the alpha channel with a small margin, so a wall mounted
access point and a 48 port switch each fill their own card instead of both
sitting in the middle of a 16:9 letterbox with the switch two hundred pixels
wide. Cards are laid out from the stored aspect, not from a fixed box.

Usage:
    python3 script/models/preview/serve.py 4310 &
    python3 script/models/build_catalogue_thumbs.py [slug ...]

With no slugs it does the whole catalogue.
