/**
 * A UniFi rack built from Ubiquiti's own geometry, and patched.
 *
 * Everything the rack pages already do assumes a chassis we modelled, which
 * means the code knows where every port is because it put them there. A
 * vendor model knows nothing: it is the real hardware and it is a closed
 * box. So the port positions come from the build definition instead, and
 * everything else, the frame, the lead shape, the jacket colours, is shared
 * with the rack pages rather than rewritten.
 *
 * The models are Draco compressed and their textures are KTX2, both of
 * which need a decoder wired in, and both decoders are served from this
 * site rather than a CDN.

 * Every patch lead, lit the way Etherlighting actually lights.
 *
 * Ubiquiti publish no model for any of their 27 cable products, which sounds
 * like a gap and is not one. A patch lead is not an object you place, it is
 * a path between two ports that do not exist until somebody decides what is
 * plugged into what, so a downloaded cable at a fixed length in a fixed pose
 * would have to be deformed along a curve computed here anyway.
 *
 * What took three attempts was the light. First the jackets were colour
 * coded like an ordinary patch panel, which is not what Etherlighting is at
 * all: the jacket is plain white and the colour lives in the plug. Then the
 * plug was a moulded boot with a tinted body, which is a cornered block
 * sitting where a light should be, and it read as a coloured object rather
 * than as something emitting.
 *
 * Light is not an object. So there is no plug body here at all. There is a
 * small unlit core at the port, a soft halo around it that is additively
 * blended so it brightens whatever is behind it the way a real glow does,
 * and the jacket itself carries the colour a short way up its own length
 * before fading to white, because that is what a translucent jacket lit
 * from one end looks like. The fade is per vertex, which also means every
 * lead in the rack is one draw call.
