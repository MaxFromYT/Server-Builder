/**
 * Load a rack's models a few at a time instead of all at once.
 *
 * The wired rack asks for ten glTF files, and their textures are embedded,
 * so what the browser is really handed is ten downloads and around thirty
 * six image decodes kicked off in the same tick. On a desktop that is fine.
 * On a phone it is not: iOS Safari decodes these through an img element
 * rather than createImageBitmap, and past a certain number of simultaneous
 * decodes some of them simply never fire load or error. Not slow, not
 * failed: nothing. The request sits there forever, the device waiting on it
 * stays behind its placeholder, and the progress readout stops partway and
 * never moves again.
 *
 * That was the eighty three percent. It was never a decoder or a transcoder
 * problem, which is worth writing down because an earlier fix went after the
 * Basis transcoder on the theory that it was: sharing one transcoder instead
 * of building ten was a real improvement and could not have been the cause,
 * because these models carry no KTX2 at all. Their textures are webp. The
 * Dell teardown was the clue and it was misread twice: it works not because
 * it is one model rather than ten, but because being one model means its
 * textures decode alone.
 *
 * So the fix is to stop asking for everything at once. Devices mount in a
 * sliding window: a few at first, and each one that finishes lets the next
 * one start. Total bytes are unchanged and the rack still fills in visibly,
 * but the browser is never holding more decodes than it can finish.
