/**
 * The rack you are building, in 3D, out of Ubiquiti's own geometry.
 *
 * This differs from the wired rack scene in one way that changes the whole
 * design: there, the build is a constant, so every model can be loaded up
 * front and the scene either works or does not. Here the build changes while
 * somebody watches, and a device added must not blank the rack that is
 * already standing. So each device gets its own Suspense boundary and its
 * own loader call, and the one that is still fetching is the only thing
 * missing from the frame.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about ports, because nothing is patched. That is not a
 * gap: a vendor model is a closed box with no idea where its own jacks are,
 * and the wired rack only manages it because its build definition says. A
 * build assembled by hand at run time has no such definition, and inventing
 * one from a bounding box would put leads in places there are no holes.
