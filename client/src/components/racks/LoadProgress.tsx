/**
 * What the models are doing, said out loud.
 *
 * These pages fetch between four and fifty megabytes of geometry, and until
 * this existed they said nothing about it. A reader on a real connection got
 * a dark rectangle with no spinner and no percentage, which is
 * indistinguishable from a broken page, and they are right to close the tab.
 *
 * Sits over the canvas rather than inside it, so it is ordinary DOM that
 * renders before any WebGL context exists and cannot itself be waiting on
 * the thing it is reporting.
 *
 * It counts files rather than models, and the label says so. A glTF carries
 * its textures inside it, and the loading manager tracks each decoded image
 * as its own item, so a ten device rack legitimately reports forty six
 * items. Calling those "models" made a normal count look like a fault.
