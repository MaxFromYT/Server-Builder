/**
 * A Cisco enterprise edge, built entirely from hardware modelled here.
 *
 * Every other rack in this library was authored from datasheets and drawn
 * as an elevation. This one is the same discipline pointed at a different
 * question: what can be built out of the products that have been modelled
 * one at a time from photographs, and does the set actually make a rack?
 *
 * It does, and this is the shape it makes. A WAN edge is a real position in
 * a network and it has a real order to it: the circuit lands on the ASR, the
 * services router does the heavy lifting behind it, the firewall sits
 * between that and the campus, and the access switches hang off the bottom.
 * Nothing here is filler and nothing is a stand in.
 *
 * On power, the same rule as every other Cisco rack here. Cisco publish
 * power supply ratings for these platforms rather than the platform's own
 * consumption, and a PSU rating is a ceiling on what the socket must
 * deliver, not a measurement of what the box draws. Quoting one as the other
 * would multiply the real figure several times over, so `watts` is null
 * throughout and the page says "not published", which is true.
