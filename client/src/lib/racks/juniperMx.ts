/**
 * A Juniper provider edge, built entirely from hardware modelled here.
 *
 * The MX240 is the reason this rack exists and the reason it is 24U. It is
 * not a large switch, it is a card cage: five rack units of slots, and what
 * it does depends entirely on what is in them. Everything else here is
 * arranged around that, the way a real provider edge is.
 *
 * One correction worth carrying from the modelling work into the data. The
 * SRX1500 is widely described as having sixteen gigabit ports, and it has
 * twelve. The specification counts the four SFP cages alongside the twelve
 * RJ45, which is a fair way to count interfaces and a misleading way to
 * count sockets. Both the hardware guide and the studio photograph show
 * twelve copper, four SFP and four SFP+, and that is what is drawn.
 *
 * Power is null throughout for the same reason as the other Juniper rack.
 * Juniper publish power supply options rather than platform consumption, and
 * a 1100W PSU on a switch that idles under 100W is a ceiling, not a figure.
