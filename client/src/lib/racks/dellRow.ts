/**
 * A Dell compute and storage row, built entirely from hardware modelled here.
 *
 * The interesting thing about drawing these four together is that their
 * faces are all storage and no two are alike, which is exactly the trap the
 * first version of this library fell into: one carrier shape reused
 * everywhere, so a 1U, a 2U and a top load shelf all came out as the same
 * grid of rectangles.
 *
 * They are not the same. A 2.5 inch drive cannot stand on its edge in a 1U
 * opening, so the R660 is two rows of five landscape carriers and the R760
 * is twenty four on end in a single row. That is a different moulding, not a
 * different arrangement of the same one, and it is why the two models share
 * no geometry despite being the same generation. The R760xd2 is a third
 * thing again: twelve 3.5 inch carriers in four columns of three. And the
 * ME4084 is the honest one, because its eighty four drives are behind top
 * load drawers and none of them is visible from the front at all.
 *
 * Power is null throughout. Dell publish PSU options, a configurator, and a
 * power calculator that wants a full bill of materials; none of those is the
 * machine's own draw, and a populated R760 and an empty one are not close
 * to the same number.
