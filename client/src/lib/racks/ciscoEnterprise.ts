/**
 * A full 42U Cisco enterprise rack, from access layer to compute.
 *
 * The Catalyst closet elsewhere in this library is a wiring closet: one
 * router, two switches and a UPS. This is the other end of the same
 * catalogue, and the point of drawing it is that Cisco's range is not one
 * shape repeated. In here there is a six rack unit modular chassis whose
 * line cards slide in horizontally, a six rack unit blade chassis with no
 * ports on its face at all, switches with no copper on them anywhere, and
 * servers whose entire front is drive carriers.
 *
 * Every rack unit height is Cisco's published figure, cited per device.
 * The 9404R is 6RU and the UCS 5108 is 6RU with eight half-width bays over
 * four front-accessible supplies; neither is an estimate.
 *
 * One rule runs through all of it: Cisco publish power supply ratings and
 * PoE budgets, not what a device draws. A 715W supply is not a 715W
 * switch, so `watts` is null on every powered device here, which renders
 * as "not published", which is true.
