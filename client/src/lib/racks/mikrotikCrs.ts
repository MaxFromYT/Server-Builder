/**
 * A MikroTik Cloud Router Switch stack, built entirely from hardware
 * modelled here.
 *
 * Five CRS switches in a row is a good test of whether the modelling was
 * done honestly, because MikroTik's whole product line looks alike from a
 * distance: the same black anodised extrusion, the same white silkscreen,
 * the same one rack unit. Drawn carelessly they come out as one switch
 * repeated five times.
 *
 * They are not the same. The CRS354 is a 48 port copper switch with optics
 * as an afterthought; the CRS326-24S is the mirror image, twenty four SFP+
 * cages in two rows and no copper at all; the CRS317 is sixteen cages in
 * four groups with a single management port; the CRS312 is eight 10 gigabit
 * copper ports, which is a rare and specific thing; and the CRS326-24G is
 * the cheap workhorse. Five different faces, five different port pitches,
 * and each one measured from its own photograph.
 *
 * MikroTik are unusual in publishing an actual maximum power consumption for
 * every product rather than a PSU rating, so unlike the Cisco, Juniper and
 * Dell racks in this library, these figures are real device draws taken from
 * the product pages. The PDU below them is the exception: Ubiquiti publish
 * no consumption figure for it, so that one is null.
