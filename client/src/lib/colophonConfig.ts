      "Now each post body is its own markdown file under content/posts, loaded through a dynamic import, so Vite emits one chunk per article. Metadata (title, date, tags, excerpt, word count) stays in a generated index that is cheap to hold in memory, which is why the listing page can show a read time for every post without touching a single body. Word counts are precomputed at build time for exactly that reason: the listing was calling split() on the full text of every article just to render a number.",

The entry bundle then had to statically import react-three-fiber, which statically imports three, purely to reach jsx() and the preload helper.",
      "The result was that every visitor downloaded roughly 950KB of WebGL before the page could render, including readers of the blog who would never open a canvas. The build config now pins React, the scheduler, and the preload helper into a chunk that r3f cannot absorb, and quarantines three, r3f, GSAP, Lenis, marked, and the post archive into chunks of their own.",

      "A crawler that does not execute JavaScript therefore sees the complete article, not a spinner. React's createRoot takes over the same element when the bundle loads, and because the content matches there is no flash for a human reader.",
      "The prerenderer also writes the onward links a crawler needs. The React page renders previous, next, and related posts, but a non-executing crawler used to see only a link back to the index, which made all 246 posts dead ends on the first pass. Those links are now in the static HTML too.",

Every route except the home page is a lazily loaded chunk behind Suspense, and Suspense sits inside that wrapper. Framer wrote opacity: 0 to the DOM, the child suspended, and the enter animation never started. It never recovered: the wrapper held opacity: 0 indefinitely. The page rendered, laid out, and was completely invisible. Clicking any navigation link produced a blank screen.",
      "It is a CSS keyframe now. A keyframe is owned by the compositor rather than a React lifecycle, and opacity: 1 is the element's natural state, so the worst case for the animation failing is that the page simply appears. A page transition is decoration. It must never be the thing that decides whether the site is visible.",
      "The same wrapper carries a second constraint. transform, filter, backdrop-filter, perspective, contain, and will-change all create a containing block, and a fixed element resolves against the nearest one. Framer leaves an animated property on the element after the transition ends, so a stray filter: blur(0px) there would silently make this div the containing block for the whole application, and GSAP's pinned hero would scroll away instead of pinning. Opacity does not create a containing block. That is why the transition animates nothing else.",

A reader who only reads the blog never fetches it. State that persists (theme, reading position, simulator saves) lives in localStorage in the reader's own browser, because there is nowhere else for it to go.",
