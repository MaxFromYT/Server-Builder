/**
 * The site's own roadmap.
 *
 * One entry per planned improvement, with an honest status. This is public
 * at /roadmap: a portfolio that shows its own backlog, including the parts
 * that are not done, is more convincing than one that only shows finished
 * work.
 *
 * Statuses mean exactly what they say. "done" requires the thing to be
 * live and verified, not merely written. "blocked" means it needs an
 * account, a credential, or a decision that only Max can make, and the
 * reason is stated. Nothing is marked done to make the list look better.
