/*
  Service worker for maxdoubin.com.

  Purpose: let someone keep reading an article they already opened when the
  connection drops, make repeat visits instant, and give the installed app
  something to boot from with no network at all. Nothing more than that.

  A service worker outlives the deploy that installed it, so the failure mode
  for getting this wrong is not "the offline page looks bad", it is "every
  returning visitor sees a permanently broken site and cannot clear it
  themselves". Every rule below exists because of a specific way that happens.

  1. CACHE_VERSION is part of every cache name, and activate deletes every
     cache this version does not own. Bumping the version is a full reset, so
     stale entries cannot accumulate across deploys. Bump it whenever the
     shape of what is stored changes, not just when a bug is fixed.

  2. NO HTML DOCUMENT IS EVER SERVED WITHOUT A REVALIDATION BEHIND IT.
     This is the rule that stops sites bricking. A prerendered document hard
     codes content hashed asset filenames (/assets/index-BkpAYz8l.js). After a
     redeploy those files are gone from the CDN. A document served from cache
     with no refresh scheduled would keep asking for asset URLs that now 404,
     forever, and the reader has no way to clear it. So documents are stale
     while revalidate: the cached copy is handed over immediately and a fresh
     one is pulled in the background for next time. The staleness window is
     exactly one page load, never longer.

  3. Even one stale load is capped by MAX_STALE_DOCUMENT_MS. Past that age a
     cached document is treated as a fallback only, and the network goes
     first. A document cached three weeks ago is far more likely to reference
     assets the CDN has dropped than one cached this morning, and the reader
     is more likely to want the current text.

  4. Cache first is correct for /assets/* and for the Google Fonts files
     precisely because those names are content hashed: the URL changes
     whenever the bytes do, so a hit can never be stale and revalidating one
     is pure waste. The hash IS the revalidation. This is also what makes
     rule 2 survivable: when a slightly stale document asks for last deploy's
     chunk, this worker still has that exact file.

  5. EVERY CACHE IS BOUNDED. Nothing here re-installs on a content deploy,
     because sw.js only changes when this file changes, so activate almost
     never runs and cannot be relied on to evict anything. Without a per cache
     ceiling the asset cache grows by a few hundred KB per deploy forever and
     surfaces months later as a QuotaExceededError, at which point every
     cache.put silently fails and the site quietly stops working offline.
     Numbers below are sized against the real build: 336 documents averaging
     30KB, 336 asset files totalling 5.9MB, 471 post covers with a 477KB
     worst case.

  6. Only GET is touched, and cross origin is limited to the two Google Fonts
     hosts. /api/* is skipped: those calls are answered inside the page by
     lib/local-api, and a cached API response would be a correctness bug.

  7. skipWaiting plus clients.claim, so a fix ships on the next load rather
     than waiting for every tab to close. Safe here only because a newly
     activated worker has empty caches and every miss falls through to the
     network.

  8. The offline document is a string in this file rather than a separate
     /offline.html. A fallback that has to be fetched from a cache can be
     missing at exactly the moment it is needed (install ran while offline,
     storage refused the write, the entry got trimmed). A string cannot.
     It also keeps a non route out of dist/public, which the CI checks walk
     expecting every HTML file to be a crawlable page with a canonical.

    A document is not just another asset: it is the manifest that names every

    browser a list of filenames from whenever it was cached, and a deploy
    since then has replaced those files with differently hashed ones. The
    server no longer has the old names and the cache may have evicted them,
    so the lazy imports 404 and the app shows its chunk-load error boundary.

    That is what this used to do. It served any copy under a day old and
    refreshed behind the reader, which is the right trade for a page whose
    assets are stable and the wrong one for a site that deploys several times
    in an afternoon: every reload handed back one more stale manifest, so the
    error survived reloading and looked like a broken site rather than a
    cache. Ten deploys in a day made it permanent.

    So the network decides, and the cache is what it should have been all
    along: the offline answer. The timeout keeps a slow connection from
